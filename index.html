Each sweet innocent mistake and moments of embarassment, we go through it all. Sure - We have our downers. But nobody's near-perfect. And my girlfriend has a level of understanding that I should seriously appreciate more. I'm so grateful that every time I look into your eyes, I see our future together. And as we approach that, I never want to let you forget that I love you buttercup, more than any word or piece of art can ever describe.
